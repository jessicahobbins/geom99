            <h2>Kazuto Gillingham</h2>
            <p>GIS Applications Specialist</p>
            <p>
                Kazuto's first introduction to GIS was in a remote sensing course he took during his undergraduate degree at Queen's University, where he majored in
                geology. After graduating and working in the mineral exploration industry for several years, he realized how ubiquitous and valuable 
                GIS skills are in geology and many other industries. He enrolled in the GIS Applications Specialist program at Fleming 
                in 2020 and hopes to use the skills he acquires to further advance his career in geology.
