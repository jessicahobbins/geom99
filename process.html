    <h2>Problem Definition</h2>

    <p>The first step of this project entailed fine tuning a problem statement. We knew that we wanted to explore Story
      Maps since our collab client,
      Friends of Temagami, requested a Story Map diving into the history of their organization. Delving into the
      technology now would prepare us for
      collaborating with them later. Additionally, since neither of us were familiar with the Friends of Temagami or the
      Temagami region in general,
      this project offered a great opportunity to begin learning more about the organization and area.</p>
    <p>Initially, we were going to focus our Story Map on the Friends of Temagami organization, giving us a focus in
      line with our collab project expectations
      that we would be able to build upon later. However, once Shawn recommended making a resource that would be
      something us, as people who have never visited Temagami,
      would like to see, it was immediately obvious that this would make for a great topic.
      Not only would this project form a great introduction to the area for us, it would ensure that our collab partner
      that
      was not enrolled in geom99 with us wouldn't be left out of completing collab tasks.
    </p>
    <h2>Planning</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Since we were just a team of 2, ensuring that we didn't over extend ourselves during this project was an
      important consideration.
      We wanted to create a great product while being realistic with the available time that we had.
    </p>
    <p>We began by outlining the Story Map in an online document, where we could both add and edit information. We
      briefly described the main features of each of the parks within Temagami.
    </p>
    <h2>Crowdsourcing Content</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>One of the biggest struggles we encountered during our project was sourcing content with permission. Temagami
      features abundant crown land,
      26 conservation reserves, 7 operating parks and 8 non-operating parks. In order to properly feature all of this
      land and provide
      an insight into the outdoor opportunities that Temagami offers, photos are crucial.</p>
    <p>Jessica drafted together a message requesting any relevant photos or information and posted it in a few
      backcountry camping
      groups on Facebook, with great results. People were very excited and eager to share their content and this is how
      we sourced many of our photos.
      When we found ourselves needing more, Jessica would search for images, track down the author and send them a
      personal message asking for permission to
      use their photo(s). Again, everyone was super helpful and every message was returned with permission granted.

    <p>While talking to people who had visited the area, a name that kept popping up was Hap Wilson. Hap is a renowned naturalist in the area
      and operates Cabin Falls Ecolodge in Temagami. Kazuto reached out to him and he provided us with some helpful information and also recommended his book,
      "Temagami Canoe Routes". Unfortunately, we weren't able to track down a copy of his book that was immediately available but Kazuto did request a hold on one in the library
      that we will hopefully be able to get later and use in our collab project.
