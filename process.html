    <p>The first step of this project entailed fine tuning a problem statement. We knew that we wanted to explore Story
      Maps since our collab client,
      Friends of Temagami, requested a Story Map diving into the history of their organization. Delving into the
      technology now would prepare us for
      collaborating with them later. Additionally, since neither of us were familiar with the Friends of Temagami or the
      Temagami region in general,
      this project offered a great opportunity to begin learning more about the organization and area.</p>
    <p>Initially, we were going to focus our Story Map on the Friends of Temagami organization, giving us a focus in
      line with our collab project expectations
      that we would be able to build upon later. However, once Shawn recommended making a resource that would be
      something us, as people who have never visited Temagami,
      would like to see, it was immediately obvious that this would make for a great topic.
      Not only would this project form a great introduction to the area for us, it would ensure that our collab partner
      that
      was not enrolled in geom99 with us wouldn't be left out of completing collab tasks.
    </p>
    <!-- Planning Section -->
    <h2>Planning</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Since we were just a team of 2, ensuring that we didn't over extend ourselves during this project was an
      important consideration.
      We wanted to create a great product while being realistic with the available time that we had.
    </p>
    <p>We began by outlining the Story Map in an online document, where we could both add and edit information. We
      briefly described the main features of each of the parks within Temagami.
    </p>
    <!-- Crowdsourcing Content Section -->
    <h2>Crowdsourcing Content</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>One of the biggest struggles we encountered during our project was sourcing content with permission. Temagami
      features abundant crown land,
      26 conservation reserves, 7 operating parks and 8 non-operating parks. In order to properly feature all of this
      land and provide
      an insight into the outdoor opportunities that Temagami offers, photos are crucial.</p>
    <p>Jessica drafted together a message requesting any relevant photos or information and posted it in a few
      backcountry camping
      groups on Facebook, with great results. People were very excited and eager to share their content and this is how
      we sourced many of our photos.
      When we found ourselves needing more, Jessica would search for images, track down the author and send them a
      personal message asking for permission to
      use their photo(s). Again, everyone was super helpful and every message was returned with permission granted. To
      facilitate sharing these photos,
      Jessica created a shared google album.
    </p>

    <p>While talking to people who had visited the area, a name that kept popping up was Hap Wilson. Hap is a renowned
      naturalist in the area
      and operates Cabin Falls Ecolodge in Temagami. Kazuto reached out to him and he provided us with some helpful
      information and also recommended his book,
      "Temagami Canoe Routes". Unfortunately, we weren't able to track down a copy of his book that was immediately
      available but Kazuto did request a hold on one in the library
      that we will hopefully be able to get later and use in our collab project.
    </p>
    <p>Most of the layers featured on our maps were sourced from Friends of Temagami, including the Temagami boundary,
      trails, portages and campsites. The operating and non-operating
      park boundaries were sourced from LIO. The blockade features were digitized by Jessica using the Story Maps
      express maps, while referencing a blockade map by Ottertooth.

    <!-- Story Map Construction Section -->
    <h2>Story Map Construction</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Initially, we selected the ArcGIS Story Maps blank template and began building our Story Map. As we progressed,
      we realized how much information there really
      was to cover and our story became longer and longer. We had a section that covered general details of Temagami and
      then separate sections for Operating and Non-Operating Parks.
      During one of our technical reviews, Shawn recommended utilizing tabs to split up the information. Jessica
      researched how to do this and we ended up removing the Operating and Non-Operating
      Park information from the original Story Map, keeping that one solely about broad details of the region, and
      creating two additional Story Maps that utilized Map Tours. We then embedded
      all three Story Maps into a Story Map Series, which provides tab functionality to navigate between stories.
    </p>
    <img src="images\storymap.jpg" alt="Story Map Photos Screenshot" width="600px" style="padding-left:250px">
    <p>The Map Tour side panel widget made it much easier to briefly feature each of the parks, as prior to discovering this tool,
      we were creating separate maps for every single park. The side panel allows us to tour the user through all of the parks on a single map, where each 
      park has its own point that is zoomed to as the user scrolls through the page.
