      The first step of this project was to figure out what web technology we wanted to explore. Friends of Temagami, 
      our clients for the collaborative project, had requested a Story Map that would illustrate the history of their 
      organization; we thought it would be a great idea to use this opportunity to further explore the capabilities 
      of the ESRI Story Map. Diving into the technology now would prepare us well for collaborating with them later. 
      Additionally, since neither of us were familiar with the Friends of Temagami or Temagami in general, this 
      project offered a great opportunity to begin learning more about the organization and area.
    </p>
    <p>
      Initially, we were going to focus our Story Map on the history and activities Friends of Temagami organization, 
      giving us a focus in line with our collaborative project expectations that we would be able to build upon later. 
      However, upon discussing the idea further with our instructor Shawn, we concluded that for the scope of this 
      project it would be more productive to create a resource with a broader scope. The overall philosophy would be 
      to make a Story Map that would be of help to people like us, who have never visited Temagami and are very 
      interested in going. Not only would this serve as a great introduction to the area for us, it would also ensure 
      that our third collaborative project group member, who is not enrolled in this course, wouldn't miss out on the 
      chance to work on the Story Map for our clients.

      Being a team of 2, making sure that we set realistic goals for ourselves was important as to not overextend ourselves. 
      We wanted to create a high-quality product while still being realistic about the time that we had.
    </p>
    <p> 
      The planning process began with brainstorming sections that could be included in the Story Map. We had a basic idea 
      of what a Story Map was but were still unfamiliar with many of the features, so research was done to learn of the 
      tools that were available to us. Existing Story Maps were consulted for inspiration, such as those made by the 
      National Park Service. Some excellent examples can be found <a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/20-story-maps.htm" target="_blank">here.</a>

      One of the issues we ran into early on was the question of how to source photographs, with permission. Temagami 
      covers a massive area and to properly showcase this diverse landscape and the many outdoor opportunities 
      available to visitors, photos are essential.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jessica drafted together a message requesting any relevant photos or information and posted it in several backcountry 
      camping groups on Facebook, with great results. People were very excited and eager to share their content; this is 
      how we sourced many of our photos. When we found ourselves needing more, Jessica searched for images, tracked down 
      the author, and sent them a message asking for permission to use their photo(s). Again, everyone was very helpful 
      and all messages were returned with permission granted. The collected photos were compiled in a shared Google photos album.

      While talking to people who had visited the area, the name Hap Wilson came up several times. Hap is a renowned 
      naturalist, author, artist, and environmental activist in the area and operates the Cabin Falls Ecolodge within 
      Temagami. Kazuto sent him an email outlining who we were and what our project was about, and he responded very 
      quickly with some useful information and tips. He mentioned “Temagami Canoe Routes”, a book he authored in 1988, 
      which is still considered the go-to guide for information. Unfortunately, we were not able to obtain a copy of 
      this book within the timeline of this project. Kazuto placed a hold on a copy at the Ottawa library, which will 
      still be a valuable source of information for the Friends of Temagami story map. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the layers featured on our maps were sourced from Friends of Temagami, including the Temagami boundary, 
      trails, portages, and campsites. The operating and non-operating provincial park boundaries were sourced from 
      the Canadian Geographical Names Database (CGNDB), maintained by Natural Resources Canada. The blockade features 
      were digitized by Jessica using the Story Maps express maps, referencing a blockade map found on Ottertooth.com.

      We initially selected the blank ArcGIS Story Maps template. As we progressed, we realized our Story Map had become
       too long and that there was too much information to cover on one page. We had sections that covered the general 
       details of Temagami, operating provincial parks, and non-operating Parks, all on a single page. After some 
       deliberation, we decided to split up these sections into separate pages accessible by tabs. The solution was found 
       by Jessica, and it involved making three separate Story Maps, one for each section. These were then combined into 
       a Story Map Series, which provides the functionality to navigate between the stories using tabs.

      The Map Tour side panel widget made it much easier to briefly feature each of the parks, as prior to discovering 
      this tool, we were creating separate maps for every single park. The side panel allows us to tour the user 
      through all of the parks on a single map, where each park has its own point that is zoomed to as the user scrolls 
      through the page.

      We separated the main 'About Temagami' Story Map into several components: Introduction of the area, First Nation 
      Presence, Environmental Activism, Old Growth Forests, Hiking Trails, and Campsites & Portages. We felt that this 
      order of topics flowed well and would create interest and foster appreciation of the rich history of the region.

      Our next task will be to create a Story Map focused on the history of the Temagami area for our clients, Friends of 
      Temagami. We now have a much stronger understanding of ESRI’s technology and we feel confident in our abilities 
      to properly tackle this project.

      Here are some lessons that we have learnt when undertaking a project involving a Story Map:
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you have selected a topic, identify what the primary focus of the Story Map will be before starting a rough 
      draft – this will aid you determining what template to use. For example, if your story involves taking your reader 
      on a journey through multiple locations, consider a Story Map Tour. If you have multiple focuses, consider whether 
      these could be comfortably displayed in one Story Map without becoming too long. It’s also worth taking a look at 
      Story Map Labs for inspiration, which feature unique, one-off implementations.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it comes to sourcing data, don’t hesitate to reach out to people! We were pleasantly surprised how helpful 
      strangers were when asked to share stories and photographs of their trips. The contributions made by these people 
      were crucial in making the Story Map. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Be flexible and willing to make changes to the plan. An agile mindset, especially when exploring a new technology, 
      helps you adapt to setbacks, new developments, and priority changes.
