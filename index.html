    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>There is no all encompassing resource for someone interested in visiting Temagami to learn all about what is
      offered in regards to outdoor activities, see photos and maps, etc. Additionally, trip planning is already
      difficult in the region
      as it is so vast and contains so many land designations. Unlike other parks such as Algonquin and Killarney, there
      are not as many
      resources to assist in planning and furthermore, trips typically span more days in Temagami than these
    parks as looped routes can be difficult to achieve due to the challenge of reaching interior parks of the region.</p>
    <p>The consquence of these factors is that the public may be unaware of the opportunities for outdoor adventure that Temagami
      holds and intimidated by the trip planning process and may never end up visiting.</p>
    <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Potential visitors of Temagami will have access to an easy to understand and visually pleasing presentation of
      the camping, hiking and canoeing opportunities that are available in the area. This will inpsire visitors to go
      explore Temagami.</p>
    <p>We planned to achieve this by utilizing ArcGIS Story Maps to illustrate the activities available in Temagami via
      videos, photos, maps, anecdotes from those that have visited, etc.</p>
