      <b>Ideal:</b> Potential visitors of Temagami will have access to an easy to understand and visually pleasing 
      presentation of the camping, hiking and canoeing opportunities that are available in the area. This will inpsire 
      visitors to go explore Temagami.
      <br>
      <b>Reality:</b> There is no all encompassing resource for someone interested in visiting Temagami to learn all 
      about what is offered in regards to outdoor activities, see photos and maps, etc.
      <br>
      <b>Consequences:</b>The public may be unaware of the opportunities for outdoor adventure that Temagami holds 
      and may never end up visiting.
      <br>
      <b>Proposal:</b> Use an ArcGIS Story Map to illustrate the activities available in Temagami via videos, 
      photos, maps, anecdotes from those that have visited, etc.
      <br>
      <b>Technology Used:</b> ArcGIS Story Maps

      There is a lack of resources that provide a broad overview of the region of Temagami in its entirety. Located in 
      the Nipissing district of Northeastern Ontario, it has a rich history dating back thousands of years. There are 
      15 provincial parks, numerous conservation areas, 4700 km of canoe routes, and over 1000 campsites in the area; 
      this can make planning a trip as a newcomer a confusing affair. Unlike other parks such 
      as Algonquin and Killarney, camping trips typically take longer because of the scarcity of access 
      points and diffulty in reaching interior locations in order to be able to complete a looped route. The consquence of these factors is 
      that the public may be unaware of the opportunities for outdoor adventure that Temagami holds and intimidated by 
      the trip planning process and may never end up visiting.

      There is no all encompassing resource for someone interested in visiting Temagami to learn all about what is
      offered in regards to outdoor activities, see photos and maps, etc. Additionally, trip planning is already
      difficult in the region as it is so vast and contains so many land designations. Unlike other parks such 
      as Algonquin and Killarney, there are not as many
      resources to assist in planning and furthermore, trips typically span more days in Temagami than these
      parks as looped routes can be difficult to achieve due to the challenge of reaching interior parks of the region.

      An ESRI Story Map was suggested to as a visually pleasing way to display this information. It is not intended 
      to be an exhaustive resource, but a starting point where people will find a collection of information that 
      serves as a starting point for their trip planning process. This will illustrate the wealth of activities 
      available in Temagami using videos, photos, maps, and anecdotes from those that have visited.
